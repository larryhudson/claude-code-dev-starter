# Claude Code Guidelines

## Environment Setup

### Pre-commit hooks
- **NEVER skip pre-commit hooks** with `--no-verify`
- If pre-commit fails, fix the environment instead of bypassing it
- Ensure `pre-commit` is in the dev dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- Run `uv sync` to install dev dependencies including pre-commit
- Use `uv run pre-commit` or activate the venv to run pre-commit

### Running commands with uv
- Use `uv run <command>` to run Python tools (e.g., `uv run ruff check .`)
- Or prefix commands with the venv Python: `.venv/bin/python`
- The PATH may not include uv by default - use `$HOME/.local/bin/uv` if needed

## Package Management

- Use **npm** (not pnpm) for frontend packages
- Use **uv** for Python package management
- Add dev dependencies to `[dependency-groups] dev` in pyproject.toml

## LSP Integration

Real-time diagnostics from language servers are provided via an LSP bridge daemon that runs during Claude Code sessions.

### How it works

1. **SessionStart hook** (`.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`) starts the bridge daemon
2. **LSP bridge** (`.claude/hooks/lsp-bridge.mjs`) spawns language servers defined in config, communicates via LSP JSON-RPC, and exposes an HTTP API on a Unix socket
3. **PostToolUse hook** (`.claude/hooks/lsp-diagnostics-check.sh`) queries the bridge after every Write/Edit, surfacing errors and warnings as context

### Configuring language servers

Servers are defined in `.claude/hooks/lsp-servers.yaml`. To add a new language server, add an entry:

```yaml
  myserver:
    command: my-language-server    # binary name or path
    args: ["--stdio"]              # CLI arguments
    search:                        # project-relative paths to try
      - node_modules/.bin/my-language-server
    cwd: subdir                    # working directory (optional)
    root: subdir                   # LSP workspace root (optional)
    env:                           # extra env vars (optional)
      PATH: "${PROJECT_DIR}/node_modules/.bin:${PATH}"
    requires:                      # only start if these exist
      - tsconfig.json
    extensions:                    # file extension -> LSP language ID
      .xyz: mylang
```

The bridge resolves commands by checking `search` paths first, then falling back to `$PATH`. Servers whose `requires` files don't exist are silently skipped.

### Debugging

- Bridge logs: `.claude/hooks/lsp-bridge.log`
- Health check: `curl --unix-socket "$(cat .claude/hooks/lsp-bridge.socket)" http://localhost/health`
- Manual diagnostics: `curl --unix-socket "$(cat .claude/hooks/lsp-bridge.socket)" -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"file":"/absolute/path"}' http://localhost/diagnostics`
